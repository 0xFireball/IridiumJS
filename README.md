# IridiumJS

IridiumJS is a __Javascript interpreter__ for .NET based on the excellent [JINT](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) interpreter which provides full __ECMA 5.1__ compliance and can run on __any .NET platform__.
Because it doesn't generate any .NET bytecode nor use the DLR it runs relatively small scripts faster. It's available as a `.NETStandardv1.3` package on NuGet at <https://www.nuget.org/packages/IridiumJS>.

IridiumJS is a fork of the JINT project.
